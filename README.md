# Deep Learning Project Show Person Has Stress or No Stress

### Introduction
Stress is a growing concern globally, affecting individuals across various age groups, occupations, and regions. Identifying and managing stress at an early stage is essential to improve mental well-being and overall health. This project leverages state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), utilizing pre-trained architectures such as VGG16, MobileNet, Inception, and ResNet, to accurately classify and predict stress levels from facial images. By analyzing facial expressions in real-time, this model can help identify whether an individual is experiencing stress or not, facilitating early intervention and better mental health management.

### Key Features
- Utilizes transfer learning with models like VGG16, MobileNet, Inception, and ResNet.
- Classifies facial images into Stress and No Stress categories.
- Achieves high accuracy with robust, scalable, and efficient models for real-time stress detectio

### Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (for image processing and real-time facial detection)
- Kaggle (for dataset collection and management)

### Dataset
- The dataset consists of facial images labeled as Stress and No Stress.
- Structure:
-    Stress: Images of faces showing signs of stress or tension.
-    No Stress: Images of faces with neutral or relaxed expressions.
